1.What are ChatBots?

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) program that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile applications or by phone.
Examples : Alexa,Google,Cortana...

2.What ChatBots Can Do?

3.Architecture and Working of ChatBots?

#What is Chatbot Architecture?
Chatbot architecture is the spine of the chatbot. The type of architecture for your chatbot depends on various factors like use-case, domain, chatbot type, etc. However, the basic conversation flow remains the same. Let us learn more about the critical components of chatbot architecture:

#Chatbot architecture key points 

    #1. Question and Answer System
As the name suggests, the Q&A system is responsible for answering customers’ frequently asked questions. The question is interpreted by the Q&A system, which then replies with appropriate responses from the knowledge base. It consists of the following elements:

Manual Training: Manual training entails the domain specialist compiling a list of commonly asked user questions and mapping out the answers. It enables the chatbot to identify the most relevant questions’ answers rapidly.
Automated Training: Automated training entails sending business documents to the chatbot, such as policy documents and other Q&A type documents, and instructing it to train itself. From these documents, the engine generates a list of questions and responses. The chatbot would then be able to respond with confidence.

    #2. Environment
The environment is mainly responsible for contextualizing users’ messages using natural language processing (NLP).

The NLP Engine is the central component of the chatbot architecture. It interprets what users are saying at any given time and turns it into organized inputs that the system can process. The NLP engine uses advanced machine learning algorithms to determine the user’s intent and then match it to the bot’s supported intents list.

NLP Engine has two components:

Intent Classifier: An intent classifier maps between what a user asks and the type of action performed by the software.
Entity Extractor: The entity extractor is responsible for identifying keywords from the user’s query that helps determine what the user is looking for.
An NLP engine can also be extended to include feedback mechanism and policy learning for better overall learning of the NLP engine.

Feedback Mechanism: This includes the feedback for the chatbot provided by the users. This part of learning can be incorporated into the chatbot itself. Here, the user rates the interaction at the end of the conversation. It encourages the bot to learn from its mistakes and improve in future interactions.
Policy Learning: Policy learning is a broad framework wherein the bot is trained to create a network of happy paths in the conversation flow that increase overall end-user satisfaction.

    #3. Front-End Systems
Front-end systems are the ones where users interact with the chatbot. These are client-facing systems such as – Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Business, Slack, Google Hangouts, your website or mobile app, etc.

    #4. Node Server / Traffic Server
It is the server that deals with user traffic requests and routes them to the proper components. The response from internal components is often routed via the traffic server to the front-end systems.

   # 5. Custom Integrations
With custom integrations, your chatbot can be integrated with your existing backend systems like CRM, database, payment apps, calendar, and many such tools, to enhance the capabilities of your chatbot.
